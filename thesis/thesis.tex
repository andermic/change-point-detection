\abstract{
Physical activity recognition using accelerometer data is a rapidly emerging
field with many real-world applications. Much of the previous work in this area
has assumed that the accelerometer data has already been segmented into pure
activities, and the activity recognition task has been to classify these
segments. In reality, activity recognition would need to be applied to
"free-living" data, which is collected over a long, continuous time period and
would consist of a mixture of activities. In this thesis, we explore two
approaches for segmenting realistic free-living time series data. In the first
approach, we apply a top-down strategy in which we segment free-living data
using change-point detection algorithms and then classify the resulting segments
using supervised learning techniques. In the second approach, we employ a
bottom-up strategy in which we split the time series into small fixed-length
windows, classify these windows, and then smooth the predictions using an HMM.
Our results clearly show that the bottom-up approach is far superior to the
top-down approach in both accuracy and timeliness of detection.

I would like to acknowledge and thank my advisor, Dr. Weng-Keen Wong, for
providing me with a clear and overarching vision of this project at all stages of its
development, as well as for his general expertise and helpfulness with all of the
rough patches, sticking points, and unexpected problems that invariably
accompany an endeavor of this magnitude. I would also like to thank the
other members of my committee, Dr. Prasad Tadepalli, Dr. Raviv Raich, and Dr. Hector
Vergara, for giving their time to help supervise the final stages of this
project. Finally, thanks go to all of my family and friends who encouraged and stood by
me along the way. They are too numerous to name but they know who they are.
