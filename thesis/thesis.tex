\abstract{
Activity detection on time series sensor data is a rapidly emerging field with
a lot of potential real-world application. In previous work researchers have
unrealistically assumed that they know at which ticks in a time series the
given subject stops doing one activity and starts doing another. In this thesis
we explore the feasibility of segmenting realistic free-living time series data
using techniques from
change-point detection, and then classifying the predicted segments using
standard supervised learning techniques. We compare this to the popular
approach of splitting the time series into small windows of fixed-length,
predicting on each window with a classifier, and then smoothing over the
predictions with an HMM. We find that the HMM approach clearly outperforms the
change-point detection approach, but that change-point detection may be
promising given a modeling assumption that is appropriate to the data.

I would like to acknowledge and thank my advisor, Dr. Weng-Keen Wong, for
providing me with a clear and overarching vision of this project at all stages of its
development, as well as his general expertise and helpfulness with all of the
rough patches, sticking points, and unexpected problems that invariably
accompany an endeavor of this magnitude. I would also like to thank the
other members of my committee, Dr. Alan Fern, Dr. Raviv Raich, and Dr. Hector
Vergara, for giving their time to help supervise the final stages of this
project. Thanks go to all of my family and friends who encouraged and stood by
me along the way. They are too numerous to name but they know who they are.
