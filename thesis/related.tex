\chapter{Related Work}
As mentioned in the previous chapter, sensor systems may consist
of environmental or wearable devices. Some examples of environmental
sensors that activity detection researchers have used to
gather data are microphones \cite{fogarty06}, weight detection
panels \cite{rowan05}, cameras \cite{duong05}, and water usage detectors
\cite{fogarty06}. Researchers will generally place environmental sensors
inside of a house, have subjects live in the house for a period of time, and
attempt to predict for activity types like cooking, watching TV, etc.

Various wearable devices have been tried as well, such as RFID gloves
\cite{gu09} \cite{rowan05}, but the most popular wearable for activity detection
purposes is the accelerometer. Besides being inexpensive, accelerometers
tend to be small and lightweight, and so are fairly unobtrusive and
user-friendly. Accelerometers also gather data at a high frequency, and as such
may be used to collect a sizeable amount of data in a relatively short amount
of time.

Whether or not an accelerometer will be discriminative for a
set of activity types depends partially on where the accelerometer is worn on
a subject's body. For example, an accelerometer worn on the ankle will be
more discriminative for the activity of cycling than it would be if it was worn
on the hip, and different types of arm movements will likely be
discriminated only by an accelerometer worn on the arm. For this reason some
researchers have opted to use multiple accelerometer systems to capture
movement information from different parts of the body \cite{bao04}
\cite{devries11}. However, this approach can be cumbersome for the wearer, so a
single accelerometer is preferred when it is reasonable to assume that it will
be discriminative over the relevant set of activities. Further research has
leveraged the accelerometers found in smart phones that subjects
are likely to carry with them anyway as data collection devices
\cite{bao04} \cite{choudhury08} \cite{kwapitz10}

Activity sensor data tends to be noisy and not amenable to a
deterministic or rule-based analysis, so activity types are typically modeled
probabilistically, and activity detection is usually formulated as a supervised
learning problem. The various common supervised learning algorithms are all
familiar to the activity detection literature, though neural networks are
especially popular, such as in \cite{aminian95} \cite{song07} \cite{staudenmeyer09}.
More complicated metamodeling approaches have also been tried, such as
plurality voting with bagged, boosted, and stacked classifiers \cite{ravi05};
conditional random fields \cite{blanke10} \cite{gu09} \cite{vankasteren08} \cite{wu09}; and HMMs
\cite{gu09} \cite{lester05} \cite{pober06} \cite{wu09}.

In the past few years researchers have started to focus on the feasibility of
online activity detection \cite{keogh01} \cite{wu09}, and have started to
recognize the need to test on realistic free-living data \cite{gu09} \cite{kwapitz10}
\cite{strohrmann11}. Our contribution is to compare different change-point detection
techniques for window segmentation with the state-of-the-art (in terms of
accuracy) HMM approach on free-living data in an online setting.
