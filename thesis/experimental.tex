\section{Performance Metrics}
To measure the performance of a time series classification algorithm we used
two metrics. Accuracy is defined as the number of
ticks that an algorithm correctly classifies in a time series, over the total number of ticks
in the time series. In many applications involving streaming accelerometer data
it is important to quickly detect changes in activity type in real time, so we
were also interested in our algorithms'' detection time.
Detection time is defined as the average number of ticks
required for the algorithm to begin correctly classifying data after a
true activity change has occurred.
