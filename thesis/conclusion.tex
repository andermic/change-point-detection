\chapter{Conclusion}
The purpose of this work was to test the feasibility of classifying 
accelerometer data in real time. We were also interested in using change-point
detection techniques for deciding when one activity ended within a time series
and the next began, and to contrast this methodology with an HMM approach.
The bottom-up approach clearly outperformed the top-down approach in terms
of both accuracy and detection time, because our change-point detection
algorithms did a poor job of correctly classifying the data, and because the
HMM temporal model is very well-suited to time series data.
