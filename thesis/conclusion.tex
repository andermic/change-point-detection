\chapter{Conclusion}
The purpose of this work was to test the feasibility of using change-point
detection techniques for deciding when one activity ended within a time series
and the next began, and to contrast this technique with an HMM approach.
The bottom-up approach clearly outperformed
the top-down approach. We also showed that the performance of a change-point
detection algorithm was highly dependent on how well the data fit the modeling
assumption of the algorithm, so it is plausible that a change-point detection
algorithm with a modeling assumption that is in accord with the given data will
perform well.
