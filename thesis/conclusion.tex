\chapter{Conclusion}
The purpose of this work was to test the feasibility of classifying 
accelerometer data in real time. We were also interested in using change-point
detection techniques for deciding when one activity ended within a time series
and the next began, and to contrast this methodology with an HMM approach.
The bottom-up approach clearly outperformed the top-down approach in terms
of both accuracy and detection time, because our change-point detection
algorithms did a poor job of correctly classifying the data. Additionally, we
showed that both the detection time and the computation time required by our
best performing approaches were low enough for online activity recognition to be
feasible.
