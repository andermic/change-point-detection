Kernel function:
	-A function that redefines the distance between two data points.
	-Can use kernel substitution in any ML algorithm based on the inner product of the vectors.
	-Transforms the data points into a higher dimensional space, and maximizing or minimizing the distance between them becomes a convex optimization problem.


Sugiyama paper:
	1) Formulate change-point detection as a hypothesis test. Null hypothesis is that the reference and test data come from the same distribution. Alternate hypothesis is that they come from different distributions. If H_0/H_1 (importance) is too small, raise an alarm.
	2) Represent the distance between the reference and test data with a radial-basis Gaussian kernel function. Find the best estimate of the likelihood ratio by solving an equivalent convex optimization problem.
	3) The above is a batch algorithm. Online-ify it by recursively building a new solution from the previous solution. Dynamic programming/memoization. Adding a new data element with this method requires constant time instead of O(n) time.
	4) Test the performance of the proposed method using real and artificial datasets (continuous data).


General notes:
	-Euclidean distance based method.
