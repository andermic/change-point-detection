Change-point detection is the problem of discovering time points at which properties of time-series data change. Possible approaches:

-Singular-spectrum analysis
	-Evaluates degree of changes between sequences using a distance function defined by "singular spectrums."

-Change finder
	-2002, 2006
	-Application of AR

-Subspace identification
	-2003
	-Distance-based

-One-class support vector machine
	-2005
	-Model free
	-Compare the support of densities of reference data to test interval data

-AR (Autoregressive model)
	-Parametric modeling

-KDE (Kernel Density Estimation)
	-Non-parametric
	-Generic density estimation approach

-Direct density-ratio estimation (online)
	-Avoids the computationally expensive non-parametric density estimation
	-Fast, because it estimates the ratio of densities instead of the densities themselves.

-CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) (online algorithm)
	-Model free
	-Provides a confidence interval that a change occurred.
	-Cannot localize the exact moment of the change, only approximate it.
	-O(n) time algorithm, where n is the number of data points so far observed.

-GLR (Generalized Likelihood Ratio) (online algorithm)
	-Parametric Model based
	-Efficient

-Shewhart (online algorithm)

-Geometric moving average (online algorithm)

-For off-line change detection: Can view it as constrained clustering. Need homogenous clusters. Choose change-points such that variance between clusters is smaller than variance between...?
	-Adjusted sum of squares measures homogeneity within a cluster
	-Computational complexity of finding an optimal k-partition is C(n,k)

General notes:
-Change-point detection is used in control theory to figure out how to restore homeostasis to a dynamic system. In the control theory context, the algorithm is online and must detect changes as quickly as possible, to restore homeostasis as quickly as possible.
-One data point collected per second in some data sets, 60 data points collected in others.
